# TUM Master Informatics: Offered Lectures (WS22/23)
This document aims to provide a list of lectures that are being offered this semester for the Informatics master at TUM, grouped by area of specialization:

- TUM provides a list of modules in the Informatics master **by area of specialization** [here](https://www.in.tum.de/en/current-students/masters-programs/informatics/elective-modules/fpso-2018/) - *but without (reliable) information which modules are actually being offered*.
- The TUMonline course search lists the courses that are **actually being offered in the current semester** - *but without information about the area the course is in*.

This repo merges the two sources of information, to provide the list of lectures that are being offered, grouped by area of specialization.

*This list is not official, might be incomplete or have errors. Use with care!*

I created this list by matching modules from TUMonline that will actually be offered with the
list of elective modules. I only included lectures (VO) and lectures with integrated exercises (VI).
There may be errors: For example, new courses might be missing if they are not yet associated
with the correct curriculum on TUMonline.
